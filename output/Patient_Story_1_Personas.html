      <td>Rebecca is an admin assistant at a local community college in town earning $30,000/year. She recently separated from the father of her 3 children (ages 18mo (Lily), 3 (James) and 6 (Anna)).  Her childrenâ€™s father has not sent child support and living on her one salary while supporting the needs of three children is difficult.  Initially, after the separation, she had to stay with friends, then she found a place briefly, but they got evicted when the landlord sold the building.  She has recently found a small apartment in the city, but the rent is high.  Much of her salary goes to childcare, diapers, and rent, leaving little left over.  Either utilities or rent are late month to month.  She gets caught with shutoff letters from the utility company, but she needs electricity for her nebulizer and critical needs of her young children, resulting in healthy and abundant food being sacrificed to pay the bills.  It has all happened so fast she has little awareness of the resources that might make it all better.  Rebeccas asthma is poorly controlled, and she has missed several days of work after running out of medication.  Although she measures her peak flows and found them consistently in the yellow zone, and even red at times, she has not been able to control the asthma by adjusting her medication because it is expensive. To compensate, she tries to space out doses to make them last longer.  She feels if she just could settle some of the stresses of living, things would be okay. She does not own a car and relies on public transportation.  Between home and daycare and work, she spends two hours on the bus daily.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Typical Routine &amp; Interactions</strong></td>
      <td>Rebeccaâ€™s typical day is to rise at 6am to get the kids up and fed.  She needs to drop them off at daycare at 7:30am in order to get the many buses to work and be there by 9am. She picks the children up again at 6:30 pm and then it is home, dinner, baths and bedtime.  This repeats daily.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Challenges &amp; Goals</strong></td>
      <td>With rent, childcare, utilities and basic necessities of 3 young children, her salary is simply not stretching far enough.  She saves money by buying low-cost foods such as macaroni and cheese and cereals and spacing out her asthma controller medication to every other day instead of daily.  She cannot afford fresh fruits and veggies. She is so tired at the end of the day she does not have much left to give.  She is uncertain whether she will receive child support payments anytime soon. Rebeccaâ€™s goals are to control her asthma condition, find more affordable medication options, feed herself and her family well, and to settle into stable, affordable, and environmentally safe housing.</td>

She really enjoys being part of a community and having long term relationships with her patients. She has been in private practice for 12 years and works alongside another Family Practitioner, an Advanced Nurse Practitioner, a Care Coordinator, two Clinical Staff Members, and two Front Office Staff Members. Carlaâ€™s practice recently became an NCQA Level 3 Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH).</td>

She often sees patients with social risk factors that she cannot readily address as a clinician. The practice sees fifty patients per day and makes another fifty phone calls a day for transitions of care and population management. Carla feels her EHR does a good job with prescription writing and medication reconciliation but is not useful with helping her document non-clinical findings.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Challenges &amp; Goals</strong></td>
      <td>Carla is becoming overworked and on the verge of burnout.  Carla is aware of other practices starting to incorporate social risk screening tools into the clinical workflow.  She would like to use her EHR to conduct initial screening for her patients and to document social risk observations during a clinical counter. She is frustrated with the lack of guidance on what codes she can use to document screening, diagnosis, goal setting, and interventions activities and thereby facilitate payment. She also struggles on how to better coordinate referrals to community-based organizations.  Most referrals are unidirectional, and she does not know whether the patient was seen by the referred provider or what the outcome of the intervention was. Her practice recently adopted a new screening tool to use for all annual wellness visits.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>What Persona wants from health care system</strong></td>
      <td>Carla wants to provide team-based whole person care, and she wants to be able to work with her clinical staff and their EHR system to document both clinical and social risk information for her patients.  This will improve her and her teams ability to identify the right interventions to meet their patients whole person needs. She wants herself and her team to use the EHR system to access relevant patient information existing in clinical and non-clinical settings, including the following:  past social risk screenings, problem list, medications and refill pattern, and diet history. She wants herself and her team to use the EHR system to support electronic closed-loop referrals to community-based organizations which can assist with navigation for specific services and programs and, in turn, optimize the care coordinators time, provide broader mitigation of the needs, enhance the overall results, and lead to higher patient and provider satisfaction. Carla would also like to more efficiently aggregate social risk data on her patients to improve her practices quality improvement initiatives.</td>

Ms. Shah wants to be able to document food insecurity in the EHR in a coded way so that it can be readily incorporated in the patient record, inform the care plan, and be used to identify the appropriate interventions. Ms. Shah is unsure how regularly Dr. Sanchez and her partner read her notes in the EHR or whether they are implementing her recommendations into a shared care plan for the high-risk patients.</td>
