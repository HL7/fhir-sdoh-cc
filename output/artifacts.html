               <td>Example of an Condition resource used to document a condition on a patient's problem list. The Condition include an onset date which records the point in time considered to be the time when the person began experiencing the condition. The Condition may include an abatement date to indicate the time when the person stopped experiencing the condition because the condition was no longer present. Onset and abatement dates can be precise to a moment in time, or generalized to a day, month, or year. The precision of the time should match the specificity of the available evidence. The Condition.asserter names the person responsible for asserting the patient's condition and the organization the asserter represented. The Condition.recorder names the person responsible for documenting the condition in the patient's record and that person's represented organization. PractitionerRole is always used to represent the practitioner and his or her associated organization. The Condition resource is conformant to the SDOHCC_Condition_FoodInsecurity_1 profile which is adapted from the US Core Condition profile.  7/18/2012: Patient is assisted by the nurse to complete a food insecurity questionnaire and is assessed at that time to have had food insecurity over the past 3 months.
