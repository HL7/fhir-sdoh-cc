<h2 id="additional-guidance">Additional Guidance</h2>
<p>The FHIR Observation, Condition and Goal resources reference one another. Therefore, to support interoperability and analytics, similar approaches have been used in the structured representation of food insecurity observations, conditions and goals.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows an example of a relationship between Observation, Condition and Goal.</p>

<p>An initial Observation (1) is evidence for a Condition (2) that is addressed by a Goal (3) that may have an outcome of a later Observation (4).</p>

<table><tr><td><img src="Observaion Mindmap 2020.png" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The sections that follow provide additional guidance on 1) rules to improve the integrity of data generated by this profile, 2) specific elements of this profile, and 3) efforts to align the profile with the following correlated Condition and Goal profiles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SDOHCC_Condition_FoodInsecurity_1</li>
  <li>SDOHCC_Goal_FoodInsecurity_1</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="observationcode">Observation.code</h3>
<p>This element references sdohcc_ValueSet_FoodInsecurity_1. 
This value set contains the SNOMED CT codes listed below.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Code</th>
      <th>Display</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>733423003</td>
      <td>Food insecurity (finding)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>sdohcc-sctt-21000243108</td>
      <td>Mild food insecurity (finding)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>sdohcc-sctt-31000243105</td>
      <td>Moderate food insecurity (finding)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>sdohcc-sctt-41000243104</td>
      <td>Severe food insecurity (finding)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The above options allow a general Food insecurity observation or a more specific Food insecurity observation (e.g., mild, moderate, or severe).</p>

<p>This value set is also used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Condition.code in SDOHCC_Condition_FoodInsecurity_1</li>
</ul>

<p>The consistent use of similar codes for a condition and an observation referenced as evidence for that condition will facilitate analytics and interoperability between Observation and Condition.</p>

<p><em>Example:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>SDOHCC_Condition_FoodInsecurity_1 modeled with:
    <ul>
      <li>Condition code = Mild food insecurity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>aligns with the observation that this condition references (via Condition.evidence.detail):</p>

<ul>
  <li>SDOHCC_Observation_FoodInsecurity_1 modeled with:
    <ul>
      <li>Observation code = Mild food insecurity</li>
      <li>Observation value = Known present<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="observationdataabsentreason">Observation.dataAbsentReason</h3>
<p>This element references sdohcc_ValueSet_ContextValue_2. The value set contains the three codes listed below which represent a subset of the FHIR DataAbsentReason value set.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Code</th>
      <th>Display</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>unknown</td>
      <td>Unknown</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>asked-unknown</td>
      <td>Asked But Unknown</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>asked-declined</td>
      <td>Asked But Declined</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="observationvalue">Observation.value</h3>
<p>This element references sdohcc_ValueSet_ContextValue_1. This value set contains the SNOMED CT codes listed below.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Code</th>
      <th>Display</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>410516002</td>
      <td>Known absent (qualifier value)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>410515003</td>
      <td>Known present (qualifier value)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>“Unknown” is not a member of the value set for Observation.value because “Unknown” is included in the FHIR value set for Observation.dataAbsentReason. Therefore, offering an alternative approach for representing that an Observation result is “Unknown” might impact semantic interoperability.</p>

<p>The Known absent (qualifier value) code in this value set is also used as a value for:<br />
•	Goal.target.detail in SDOHCC_Goal_FoodInsecurity_1</p>

<p>The consistent use of similar codes for a goal and an observation referenced as an outcome for that goal will facilitate analytics and interoperability between Observation and Goal.</p>

<p><em>Example:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>SDOHCC_Observation_FoodInsecurity_1 modeled with:
    <ul>
      <li>Observation code = Food insecurity</li>
      <li>Observation value = Known absent<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>aligns with the goal that references this observation (via Goal.outcomeReference):</p>

<ul>
  <li>SDOHCC_Goal_FoodInsecurity_1 modeled with:
    <ul>
      <li>Goal description: Food security <br /> and<br /></li>
      <li>Goal target measure = Food insecurity</li>
      <li>Goal target detail = Known absent</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="observationeffective">Observation.effective</h3>
<p>This element is constrained to dateTime or Period.</p>

<p>“dateTime” can be used to document that the observation is effective during the specified dateTime but cannot extend to future times. If “dateTime” is used for food insecurity, it is probably best handled by using by a lower precision representation (e.g., month/year or year) as opposed to a higher precision representation (e.g., year/month/date/hour/min). Additionally, dateTime does not confirm or negate the existence of the observation at any time other than the specified dateTime.</p>

<p>“Period” can be used to document that the observation is effective during the specified Period but does not confirm or negate the existence of the observation at any time other than the specified Period. Period can have a “start” and an “end” time. However, for this profile, “start” time is optional (open-ended) but “end” time is mandatory and cannot extend to future times.</p>

<p>The mandating of “end” time is still under discussion at the time of this IG. Therefore, fhirpath rules have not been added to enforce this.</p>

<h3 id="fhirpath-rules">FHIRpath rules</h3>
<p>This profile will use FHIRpath rules. The objective of the FHIRpath rules are to support creation of observations that clearly establish a patient’s food insecurity state.</p>

<p><em>Example:</em>
Moderate food insecurity = known present</p>

<p>FHIRpath rules will constrain the observations that can be created with this profile to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Food insecurity = unknown (and subtypes):
    <ul>
      <li>Food insecurity = asked-unknown</li>
      <li>Food insecurity = asked-declined</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Food insecurity = known absent (Essentially the equivalent of “Food security known present”.)</li>
  <li>Food insecurity = known present (and subtypes):
    <ul>
      <li>Mild food insecurity = known present</li>
      <li>Moderate food insecurity= known present</li>
      <li>Severe food insecurity = known present</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="rules">Rules:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Observation.value or Observation.dataAbsentReason, but NOT both, MUST be provided. <br />This rule prohibits creation of nonsense observations like “Food insecurity = known present AND unknown”.</li>
  <li>“Observation.value = Known absent” can only be used with “Observation.code = Food insecurity”. <br /> This rule prohibits creation of observations like “Mild food insecurity = Known absent” which merely exclude a possible food insecurity state rather than clearly establish a patient’s food insecurity state. <br /> This rule allows creation of the observation “Food insecurity = known absent” which implies that all states of food insecurity (including mild, moderate and severe) are absent. This clearly establishes that the patient is not in a food insecure state (e.g., equates to “Food security = known present”).</li>
  <li>Observation.dataAbsentReason can only be used with “Observation.code = Food insecurity” <br />This rule prohibits creation of observations like “Mild food insecurity = unknown” which merely establish that one possible food insecurity state is unknown. <br />This rule allows creation of observations like “Food insecurity = unknown” which imply that all states of food insecurity (including mild, moderate and severe) are unknown.</li>
</ol>
