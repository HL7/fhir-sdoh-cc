<p>Personas are commonly used in user-centered design to describe a fictional character who would represent a user type that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way.  Personas describe the fictional person in terms of their behaviors, skills, preferences, and needs.  From a data interoperability perspective, personas are used to visualize the data needs of a user type.</p>

<p>The Gravity Project personas include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rebecca Smith (Patient)</li>
  <li>Carla Sanchez (Primary Care Physician)</li>
  <li>Reeza Shah (Care Coordinator)</li>
  <li>Samir Patel (Clinical Staff Member)</li>
  <li>Sylvia Torres (Front Office Staff Member)</li>
  <li>Michael Frank (Community-Based Provider)</li>
  <li>Quality Specialist/ Health Plan Care Manager</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="PatientStory1Personas.html">Gravity Project personas</a> are presented using the following descriptors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First and last name</li>
  <li>Role (e.g., patient, practitioner, caregiver)</li>
  <li>Age</li>
  <li>Ethnicity</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="PatientStory1.html">Patient Story 1</a> describes personas engaging with a service, technology, or setting over a period of time to accomplish a specific goal.  It summarizes the interactions among personas and specifies what information is captured, shared, and exchanged from a contextual perspective.  Patient Stories serve to illustrate examples of real-world applications of technical solutions.  Although Patient Stories may not fully represent every real-world scenario in every instance, they are presented in a manner that will support and illustrate the Use Cases defined in this document.</p>

<p>From a data interoperability perspective, a patient story is used to identify the transactions where health information is shared between technical systems used by the personas in the story.</p>
