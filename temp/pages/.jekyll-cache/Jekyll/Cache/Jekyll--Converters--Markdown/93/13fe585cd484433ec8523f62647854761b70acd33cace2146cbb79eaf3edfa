<p><strong>This page is currently under development</strong></p>

<p>This section provides guidance on naming conventions for profiles, profile examples, profile instance samples, and value sets defined within the SDOH-CC implementation guide.</p>

<p>Artifact names alone cannot fully represent the intent and use case(s) of each artifact in a way that allows artifact differentiation. Therefore, the objective when assigning an artifact name is to provide unique high-level names which, to the degree possible, adhere to somewhat consistent patterns. Detailed information about an artifact will not be imparted by its name and must be obtained by referencing the full artifact.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="conventions-that-apply-to-implementation-guide-artifact-names">Conventions that Apply to Implementation Guide Artifact Names</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Uniqueness - Artifact names MUST be unique. <br /></li>
  <li>Artifact names will have segments as described in the Naming Conventions sections that follow. <br /></li>
  <li>
    <p>Capitalization <br /></p>

    <ul>
      <li>With the exception of Segment 1, the first letter in each segment of an artifacts name MUST be capitalized. <br /></li>
      <li>Tools (e.g., Trifolia, Forge, etc.) differ in their constraints on capitalization. For this reason, case for this first segment of the name may vary.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Concatenated capitalized words (Pascal Casing) MUST be used if a segment of an artifacts name contains more than one word. <br /></p>

        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      Example: SDOHCC_Observation_FoodInsecurity_1
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>File type - Tooling will automatically append the file type (e.g., StructureDefinition.xml, json, etc.) to artifact names. Therefore, file type is not included in naming conventions or examples provided here.
<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="naming-conventions-for-profiles">Naming Conventions for Profiles</h3>

<p>Gravity profile names MUST contain the segments below, separated by underscores, in the order specified.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Segment 1</strong>: SDOHCC</p>

    <p>This segment is the identifier assigned to the Gravity Project by HL7. (Case for this segment is all upper case since profiles are currently generated in Forge which requires upper case for the first letter of the name.)<br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Segment 2</strong>: FHIR resource name (e.g., Observation, Goal, etc.)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Concatenated FHIR resource names MUST be represented as in FHIR using concatenated capitalized words (Pascal Casing).</p>

        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  Example: QuestionnaireResponse 
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Segment 3</strong>: A high-level label for the content category that the profile addresses (e.g., food insecurity, housing, transportation, etc.).</p>

    <p>Overtime, it is likely that additional guidance will be developed for assigning high-level labels. It is recognized that there is subjectivity in identifying a high-level label for the category of content that the profile addresses. Therefore, achieving some degree of consistency in choosing high-level labels will be challenging. However, developing guidance for more granular category names may be even more challenging without any guarantee of improvement in consistency.<br /></p>

    <ul>
      <li>High-level labels SHOULD use the singular form.</li>
      <li>
        <p>High-level labels that cannot be described with one word (e.g., food insecurity, blood pressure) MUST use concatenated capitalized words (Pascal Casing).</p>

        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      Example: FoodInsecurity
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Segment 4</strong>: A number intended to distinguish different profiles for which Segments 1, 2 and 3 are identical. (e.g., Gravity profiles that address the same high-level category for a given FHIR resource).</p>

    <p>The first profile with a unique combination of Segments 1, 2, and 3, will be assigned a number “1” for Segment 4. As new profiles with the same unique combination of segments 1, 2, and 3 are added, numbers for Segment 4 will be assigned in sequential order.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Profile names that are identical, except for the Segment 4 number, are not versions of a single profile. Rather, they are distinct profiles that address similar high-level domains.</p>

        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     Example: "SDOHCC_Goal_FoodInsecurity_1 and SDOHCC_Goal_FoodInsecurity_2" are not versions of the same food insecurity goal profile. Rather, they are	different profiles for the Goal Resource that each address food insecurity. 
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Profiles with the same number for Segment 4 do not necessarily correlate to one another.</p>

        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     Example: "SDOHCC_Goal_FoodInsecurity_1" does not necessarily correlate with "SDOHCC_Observation_FoodInsecurity_1".

<h3 id="naming-conventions-for-profile-examples">Naming Conventions for Profile Examples</h3>

<p>The names for profile examples mirror the names of the profiles that they are examples of. Additionally, profile example names have a Segment 5 which appends “Example” to the profile name. A shortened description of each profile segment is repeated here for the readers convenience.</p>

<p>Gravity profile example names MUST contain the segments below, separated by underscores, in the order specified:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Segment 1</strong>: SDOHCC</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Segment 2</strong>: FHIR resource name (e.g., Observation, Goal, etc.)</p>

<h3 id="naming-conventions-for-resource-instance-samples">Naming Conventions for Resource Instance Samples</h3>
<p>True instances of a patient profile are not provided in an IG because some instance data (e.g., patient demographic data) cannot be shared. However, instance samples may be useful (e.g., for Connectathons).</p>

<p>The names for profile instance samples mirror the names of the profiles that they are instance samples of. Additionally, profile instance sample names have a Segment 5 which appends “InstanceSample” to the profile name. A shortened description of each profile segment is repeated here for the readers convenience.</p>

<p>Gravity profile instance samples names MUST contain the segments below, separated by underscores, in the order specified:
<br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Segment 1</strong>: SDOHCC<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="naming-conventions-for-value-sets">Naming Conventions for Value Sets</h3>

<p>The segment names for value sets are similar in purpose and order to those for profiles.</p>

<p>Gravity value set names MUST contain the segments below, separated by underscores, in the order specified:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Segment 1</strong>: sdohcc<br />
   	This segment is the identifier assigned to the Gravity Project by HL7. (Case for this segment is all lower case since value sets are currently generated in a tool (termSpace) which allows lower case for the first letter of the name.)<br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Segment 2</strong>: ValueSet</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Segment 3</strong>: A high-level label for the category of content (e.g., intervention, context value, body structure, device, etc.) that the value set contains. <br /></p>

    <p>Overtime, it is likely that additional guidance will be developed for assigning high-level labels. It is recognized that there is subjectivity in identifying a high-level label for the category of content in a value set. Therefore, achieving some degree of consistency in choosing high-level labels will be challenging. However, developing guidance for more granular category names may be even more challenging without any guarantee of improvement in consistency.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>High level labels SHOULD use the singular form (e.g. Intervention not Interventions).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>High-level labels that cannot be described with a single word (e.g., body structure) MUST use concatenated capitalized words (Pascal Casing).</p>

        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  Example: BodyStructure
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Examples of “high-level labels” for Segment 3:</em></p>

    <p>The examples were chosen to illustrate the challenges of selecting a high-level label for a value set. They illustrate how a value set might fit into more than one high-level label, although only one can be selected.</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"ContextValue" - could be the high-level label for the following value sets: 
* Absent, Present, Unknown 
* At risk, Not at risk, Unknown

"InterpretationValue" - could be a high-level label for the following value sets:
* Very low, Low, High, Very high
* Normal, Abnormal

"Intervention" - could be a high-level label for the following value sets: 
* Referral to food pantry program, Referral to garden program, Referral to delivered meals program
* Home delivered meals education, Garden program education, Nutrition education

"BodyStructure" - could be a high-level label for the following value sets: 
* Hand, Foot, Finger, Toe
* Brachial Artery, Radial Artery, Digital Artery
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: This last trio of values are an example of why labels with more granularity will not necessarily simplify the assignment of labels since any of the following labels	could have worked: “ArterialBodyStructure”, “VascularBodyStructure”, “ExtremityBodyStructure”.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Segment 4</strong>: A number to distinguish different value sets for which Segments 1, 2 and 3 are identical. (e.g., value sets that contain content with the same high-level label).</p>

    <p>The first value set with a unique combination of Segments 1, 2, and 3, be assigned a number “1” for Segment 4. As new value sets with the same unique combination of Segments 1, 2, and 3 are added, numbers for Segment 4 will be assigned in sequential order.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Value set names that are identical, except for the number assigned for Segment 4, are not versions of a single value set. Rather, they are distinct value sets that contain content categorized with the same high-level label.</p>

        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  For example, "sdohcc_ValueSet_Intervention_1" and "sdohcc_ValueSet_Intervention_2" are not versions of the same value set, but rather value sets with different Intervention content (e.g., for a different use case).
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Value sets with same number assigned for Segment 4 do not necessarily correlate to one another.</p>

<p><br />
A Value Set is a collection of coded concepts. The coded concepts can come from the same or different code systems.  This enables an IG to define Value Sets that include placeholder codes where needed. The definition of the value set and its expansion is not considered final until the IG in which the value set is defined becomes published.  Before publication, all Value Set definitions MUST be defined in an external Value Set management resource such as the HL7 UTG or NLM VSAC.
