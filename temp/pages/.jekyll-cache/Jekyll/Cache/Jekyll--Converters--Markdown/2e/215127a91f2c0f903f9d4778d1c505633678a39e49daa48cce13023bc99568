<p>Transactions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Service Request</li>
  <li>Request Completion</li>
</ol>

<p>To illustrate this use case, the role of Order Placer is filled by a Clinical Staff Member (see Table 4 below).  The Order Placer can be filled by other human actors to include the Patient and their proxy.  In this case, the Patient can use a mobile app, PHR, or patient portal to place the order and interact with the Order Filler.</p>
