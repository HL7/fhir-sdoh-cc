<h4 id="missing-data">Missing Data</h4>
<p>If the source system does not have data for a <em>Must Support</em> data element with minimum cardinality = 0, the data element is omitted from the resource. If the source system does not have data for a required data element (in other words, where the minimum cardinality is &gt; 0), follow guidance defined in the core FHIR specification and summarized in the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html#missing-data">US Core IG</a>.</p>

<p>The US Core Profiles were originally designed to meet the 2015 Edition certification criterion for Patient Selection 170.315(g)(7), and Application Access - Data Category Request 170.315(g)(8). They were created for each item in the <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/ccds_reference_document_v1_1.pdf">2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS)</a>. The 3.1.0 version of the US Core Profiles IG includes new requirements from the latest proposed ONC <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/topic/laws-regulation-and-policy/notice-proposed-rulemaking-improve-interoperability-health">U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)</a> and includes all the <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/isa/api-resource-collection-health-arch">API Resource Collection in Health (ARCH)</a> resources.</p>
