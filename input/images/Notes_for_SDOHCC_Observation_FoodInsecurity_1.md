## Additional Guidance for [SDOHCC_Observation_FoodInsecurity_1](StructureDefinition-SDOHCC-Observation-FoodInsecurity-1.html)

The FHIR Observation, Condition and Goal resources reference one another. Therefore, to support interoperability and analytics, similar approaches have been used in the structured representation of food insecurity observations, conditions and goals. 

The diagram below shows the relationships between Observation, Condition and Goal. 
An initial Observation (1) is evidence for a Condition (2) that is addressed by a Goal (3) that may have an outcome of a later Observation (4).

The sections that follow provide additional guidance on 1) rules to improve the integrity of data generated by this profile, 2) specific elements of this profile, and 3) efforts to align the profile with the following correlated Condition and Goal profiles:
* 	SDOHCC_Condition_FoodInsecurity_1
* 	SDOHCC_Goal_FoodInsecurity_1

<br>

### Observation.code

This element references sdohcc_ValueSet_FoodInsecurity_1. This value set contains the SNOMED CT codes listed below.

| Code                    | Display                            |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 733423003               | Food insecurity (finding)          |
| sdohcc-sctt-21000243108 | Mild food insecurity (finding)     |
| sdohcc-sctt-31000243105 | Moderate food insecurity (finding) |
| sdohcc-sctt-41000243104 | Severe food insecurity (finding) |
{:class="table table-bordered"}
{:.table-striped}

The consistent use of similar codes for a condition and an observation referenced as evidence for that condition will facilitate analytics and interoperability between Observation and Condition.

**Example:**

* 	SDOHCC_Condition_FoodInsecurity_1 modeled with:
	* 	Condition code = Mild food insecurity 
	
aligns with the observation that this condition references (via Condition.evidence.detail):
* 	SDOHCC_Observation_FoodInsecurity_1 modeled with:
	* 		Observation code = Mild food insecurity
	* 		Observation value = Known present

<br>


### Observation.dataAbsentReason

This element references the FHIR DataAbsentReason value set. Although the referenced FHIR value set contains more codes than the three below, only the codes listed below should be used for this profile.

| Code           | Display            |
|----------------|--------------------|
| unknown        | Unknown            |
| asked-unknown  | Asked But Unknown  |
| asked-declined | Asked But Declined |
{:class="table table-bordered"}
{:.table-striped}

<br>

### Observation.value

This element references sdohcc_ValueSet_ContextValue_1. This value set contains the SNOMED CT codes listed below.

| Code      | Display                         |
|-----------|---------------------------------|
| 410516002 | Known absent (qualifier value)  |
| 410515003 | Known present (qualifier value) |
{:class="table table-bordered"}
{:.table-striped}


The Known absent (qualifier value) code in this value set is also used as a value for:
* Goal.target.detail in SDOHCC_Goal_FoodInsecurity_1 

The consistent use of similar codes for a goal and an observation referenced as an outcome for that goal will facilitate analytics and interoperability between Observation and Goal.

**Example:**

* SDOHCC_Observation_FoodInsecurity_1 modeled with:
	* Observation code = Food insecurity 
	* Observation value = Known absent

aligns with the goal that references this observation (via Goal.outcomeReference):

* SDOHCC_Goal_FoodInsecurity_1 modeled with:
	* Goal description: Food security <br>
and <br>
	* Goal target measure = Food insecurity
	* Goal target detail = Known absent

<br>

### Observation.effective

This element is constrained to Period. Date is not allowed since, unlike some observations (e.g., a seizure, body weight, etc.) that occur at a point in time, the observation of Food insecurity is about a state that is present over an extended period of time (e.g., the past month, year, etc.).

<br>

### FHIRpath rules 

This profile will use FHIRpath rules. The objective of the FHIRpath rules are to support creation of observations that clearly establish a patients food insecurity state. 

**Example:**
Moderate food insecurity = known present 

FHIRpath rules will constrain the observations that can be created with this profile to:
* Food insecurity = unknown (and subtypes):
	* Food insecurity = asked-unknown 
	* Food insecurity = asked-declined
	
* Food insecurity = known absent (Essentially the equivalent of Food security known present.)
* Food insecurity = known present (and subtypes):
	* Mild food insecurity = known present
	* Moderate food insecurity= known present
	* Severe food insecurity = known present

<br>

### Rules:

1.	Observation.value or Observation.dataAbsentReason, but NOT both, MUST be provided.<br>	This rule prohibits creation of nonsense observations like Food insecurity = known present AND unknown.<br>
2.		Observation.value = Known absent can only be used with Observation.code = Food insecurity.<br>This rule prohibits creation of observations like Mild food insecurity = Known absent which merely exclude a possible food insecurity state rather than clearly establish a patients food insecurity state.<br>This rule allows creation of the observation Food insecurity = known absent which implies that all states of food insecurity (including mild, moderate and severe) are absent. This clearly establishes that the patient is not in a food insecure state (e.g., equates to Food security = known present).<br>
3.		Observation.dataAbsentReason can only be used with Observation.code = Food insecurity<br>This rule prohibits creation of observations like Mild food insecurity = unknown which merely establish that one possible food insecurity state is unknown.<br>This rule allows creation of observations like Food insecurity = unknown which imply that all states of food insecurity (including mild, moderate and severe) are unknown.   <br>
