Capability Statements define the specific capabilities a system is expected to have in order to comply with one of the System Actors defined in this implementation guide. 

This IG defines a collection of profiles for representing screening information for food insecurity and documenting clinical data related to food insecurity which a clinician would record during a patient visit. It also defines profiles that support making a referral for services to address food insecurity and supplying feedback about a completed referral.

Systems complying with the SDOH-CC implementation guide are expected to declare conformance to one or more of the following capability statements:

* SDOH-CC PMEHR: Practice management electronic health record
* SDOH-CC Screening App/Patient App
* SDOH-CC Clinical Data Registry/Repository

The exchange of data between the PMEHR and the Screening App, and between the PMEHR and the Clinical Data Registry/Repository is a works-in-progress. As a result, the Capability Statements in the IG are incomplete. The Capability Statement for the Clinical Data Reg/Repo actor has not yet been drafted at all.

There are several possible ways to implement data exchange in FHIR.  Some exchange methods are more mature than others. Initially, the SDOH-CC Capability Statements address the most straightforward RESTful-based exchange methods.  As a result of feedback and the maturation of work on other exchange methods within the FHIR Community, the Capability Statements included in this IG likely will be modified. Over time, work on the FHIR CDex, BSer, and HRex IGs will inform the information exchange methods utilized by this IG.
