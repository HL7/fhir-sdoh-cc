### Temporary IdentifierSystem
A Temporary IdentifierSystem is used in this IG to demonstrate where resources need to include an actual identifier system namespace. 

<br>
### Purpose
Certain resources, such a Questionnaires used for screening patients, need to be uniquely identified by the organization who has defined or is using the Questionnaire.  In order to provide guidance on where identification systems are needed, this IG creates a Code System resource called "SDOH-CC IdentifierSystem Temporary Identifiers". This resource establishes a URI that is used in examples as a placeholder for an actual identifier namespace needed for implementation.  

<br>
### Implementer Guidance for Temporary IdentifierSystem 
The Temporary Identifier System used in examples within this IG need to be replaced by actual identifier system namespaces.
