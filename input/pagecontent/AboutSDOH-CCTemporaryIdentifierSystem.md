### Temporary Identifier Systems
Temporary Identifier Systems are used in IGs to demonstrate how to identify certain resources that need to be identified for an actual implementation.  Temporary identification systems used in this IG need to be replaced by the intended actual identification systems when conforming to the IG.

### Purpose
Certain resources, such a Questionnaires used for screening patients, need to be uniquely identified by the organization who has defined the Questionnaire.  In order to provide guidance on where identification systems are needed, this IG creates temporary identification systems established to define the actual identification systems needed for implementation.  The following material describes how to the temporary identification systems are specified in this IG and explains how implementers would modify the temporary information when utilizing this guidance in actual implementations.
